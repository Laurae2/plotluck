Description: A 'ggplot2'-based tool for quickly generating visualizations during
    exploratory data analysis with the aim of letting the user focus on what to
    plot, not on the "how". 'Plotluck' examines the data characteristics of up to
    three variables and accordingly creates a scatter, violin, box, bar, density,
    hex or spine plot, or a heat map. It also automates handling of observation
    weights,log-scaling of axes, reordering of factor levels, and overlays of
    smoothing curves and median lines.
