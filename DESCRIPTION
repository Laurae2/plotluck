Description: A tool for quickly generating appropriate ggplots during
    exploratory data analysis. Plotluck examines one, two, or three variables
    and creates, based on their characteristics, a scatter, box, bar, density,
    hex or spine plot, or a heat map. It also automates handling of observation
    weights,log-scaling of axes, reordering of factor levels, and overlays of
    smoothing curves and median lines.
