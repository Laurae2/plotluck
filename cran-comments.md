This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* In the DESCRIPTION, put software names in single quotes; slightly reformulated
* Regenerated the vignette to be in sync with the source.
* Corrected a wrong use of testthat::skip_on_cran() in the tests

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
